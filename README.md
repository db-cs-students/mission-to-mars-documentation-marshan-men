## Our soulution 
We tracked the direction, x, y, and z by appling code to the micro bit.
We used tinkercade to design and print the enclosher for the mirco bit.

## Overview of Process
Brady did the design for the box and most of the stuff on tinkercad, while me and caden were programing each microbit. We do not have our prototype but it improved into the box we used for the assignment. 
## Team Reflection
I feel like me and my team did a good job with the project, i feel like the prgraming and the design of the box was very succesful, but i would like to improve on our box a little because it didn't have a lid but other then that i feel like our soultion was pretty good.
